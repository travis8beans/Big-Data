# Big-Data

Are you an obstetrician? Do you have patients that are indecisive on names, or have patients that are choosing bad names like "Lasagna" or "Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso"? Are you one of those parents? Well we have the resources for you!

Travis Thomas, Seth Goodson and Seth Francke were asked to create a website to offer obstetricians a method of giving patients a baby naming system.

2. Describe the area of focus you and your partner chose to explore and explain why you chose this area. Your answer should be **no more than 200 words.** 

We sought to answer these questions with this service:

  a) What are the **most popular** set of names the **male sex** has (top 10)?
   
  b) What are the **most popular** set of names the **female sex** has (top 10)?

  d) What are the **least popular** set of names the **female sex** has (bottom 10)?
   
  e) How can we intergrate this data with searchability, which accounts for ethnicity, sex, etc.?

4.	Identify each permanent data set you used. For each set, you must: 
  - Provide the permanent URL.
  https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/
  - Briefly describe the data set. **Each description should be no more than 100 words.**
  
This collection of data percribes the top 1000 names of each sex in the U.S., based on Social Security number and date of birth. It organizes the data by the sex and period of time, i.e., and is relevant most to the systems that use names as a way to compare those you know most to the searchability.
  - Provide the date on which you accessed each data set. 
  Feb 16th, 2018

6.	Explain how your questions and answers contribute to the development of insight and knowledge in your chosen area of inquiry. Your explanation should be **no more than 300 words.** Attach (as PDFs) and reference any appropriate non-textual representations. Include a one-sentence description of each non-textual attachment.

The first questions are to clarify our main information, showing the most popular and least popular baby names for male and female babies in 2016. This data can be used to predict what names will be popular in following years, especially if compared with older data. These names should be openly available for anyone to look at as they are now, but should also be readily available around hospitals in areas where they may be needed, for example, with the carrying parent or when the baby is born.
